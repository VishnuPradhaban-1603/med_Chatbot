# Medical Chatbot Project 

## Introduction
Welcome to the project overview for the Medical Chatbot project. This document outlines the purpose, scope, and key objectives of the project.

## Project Name
med_Chatbot - Medical Chatbot

## Project Description
Developed and customized an AI-powered Medical Chatbot with advanced NLP, Transformers (BERT), and AI-driven multi-symptom analysis for improved accuracy. Integrated a FastAPI-based backend with a React.js front-end, allowing real-time medical assistance. Upgraded chatbot with Agentic AI (ChatGPT) for conversational diagnosis, FHIR-compliant EHR integration, and medical API connections (WHO, Mayo Clinic) for enhanced health insights. Optimized model inference, reducing processing time by 40%, while enabling secure AWS/GCP-based deployment for large-scale users.


## Key Enhancements:
	•	FastAPI Backend for better request handling.
	•	Optimized NLP pipeline using pre-trained embeddings.
	•	Multi-Symptom Analysis for improved diagnostic accuracy.
	•	Agentic AI Model integration for conversational responses.
	•	Streamlined Deployment using Hugging Face Spaces.

## Key Objectives
- **Deliver Accurate Information:** Provide users with up-to-date and trustworthy medical information.
- **Symptom Analysis:** Enable users to describe their symptoms and receive preliminary insights into potential health concerns.
- **Emergency Guidance:** Offer appropriate guidance for emergency situations and immediate medical attention.
- **User-Friendly Interaction:** Ensure a user-friendly and intuitive chatbot interface for easy interaction.
- **Referral to Professionals:** Direct users to consult medical professionals for accurate diagnosis and treatment plans.

## Scope
The project will cover the development of a conversational AI chatbot focused on providing medical information and initial assessments. It will not replace professional medical advice or diagnosis.

## Features
- **Real-time Responses:** Instantly respond to user queries and concerns with relevant medical information.
- **Symptom Checker:** Assist users in analyzing their symptoms and suggesting potential conditions.
- **Emergency Support:** Provide clear instructions for emergency situations and advise users to seek immediate medical help.
- **Interactive Interface:** Offer a user-friendly chat interface to engage users in meaningful health-related conversations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language for the project's development.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Technologies (NLTK, ChatGPT):** Was used to understand and preprocess user input.
- **Machine Learning - (Pytorch):** Was used to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of symptom analysis.
- **Backend Development (Python):** Was used to manage user data and responses.
- **Web Interface (Gradio):** Provided an intuitive platform for users to interact with the chatbot.
- **Deployment:** This model was deployed on hugging face space
